            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Welcome to ReformRise, where we
                 believe in the transformative power
                  of education, skill-building, and
                   justice advocacy. Our dedicated team
                    is on a mission to make a meaningful 
                    difference in the lives of incarcerated individuals 
                and those unfairly imprisoned. In a world striving for justice and inclusivity, where every
                 individual deserves a second chance, that is where Reform rise come in an NGO dedicated to dismantling the walls 
                 of discrimination against the convicted and restoring their rightful place in society. Our mission 
                 is rooted in the belief that individuals who have served their sentences deserve the opportunity to
                  rebuild their lives free from prejudice, exclusion, and stigma.

                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                     specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
                     into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
                     in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                     with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
